# android_app_attempt
tried to build an app that teaches you to use python

This app was only created as a means for me to learn about programmign mobile apps. 

Created using Android Studio.

As of this moment, the app retains user information and authenticates it. It uses Google's Firebase Database. Please note that the .json files containing user and acces keys were deleted for security reasons.
